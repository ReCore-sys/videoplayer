# ReCore's sketchy video player

So I got sick of trying to put downloaded films on my xbox, so I made this.
It's fairly basic right now but I'm happy with what I got.

Written in Python and HTML/CSS/JS, along with [video.js](https://videojs.com) to play the videos and [themoviedb ](https://www.themoviedb.org/)to get info about the films.
