# ReCore's sketchy video player

So I got sick of trying to put downloaded films on my xbox, so I made this.
It's fairly basic right now but I'm happy with what I got.

Written in Python and HTML/CSS/JS, along with [Plyr](https://plyr.io) to play the videos and [themoviedb ](https://www.themoviedb.org/)to get info about the films.

List of todos:

1. Redo the UI to actually be nice. Have a look at sites likes fireship.io and supabase
2. Get the torrents working
3. Webscraping piratebay and other torrent sites
